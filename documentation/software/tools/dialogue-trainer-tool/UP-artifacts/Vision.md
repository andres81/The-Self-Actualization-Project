# Dialogue Trainer Tool Vision

The idea behind the Dialogue Trainer Tool (DTT) primarily is to dissect a
dialogue with the purpose of fulfilling a plethora of use cases. The tool will
offer the dialogue itself to a user, but in addition will allow more than only
using the overview. One can think of analyzing a single line, adding text
commentary to a dialogue, seeing translations to other languages, audio offering
the user to hear the pronunciation of the line and the dialogue. If the dialogue
is also available in video format, an embedded video player can present it with
the dialogue.

Not only can the tool therefore be used then in the context of language
learning, but also for example in the context of conversation training, or
conflict analysis: Recording conversations, making a transcript, and having the
ability to annotate lines and adding commentary between lines, offers the
ability to present metadata regarding the dialogue.
