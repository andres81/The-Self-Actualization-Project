# Dialogue Trainer Tool Ideas

## Introduction

## Guess the order of the dialogue lines v1

Present the dialogue, but only the main lines, not the translations, nor the
ability to play the audio that is the spoken line. Present the lines in a random
order. Shuffled so to say. The audio of the complete dialogue is availabe as
well as optionally the video belonging to the dialogue.

The idea here is that the practitioner, has to deduce the order of the lines
based on an audio presentation.

## Guess the order of the dialogue lines v2

As version 1, but now not the main lines but instead only the translations are
presented.
