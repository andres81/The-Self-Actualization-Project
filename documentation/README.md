## Introduction

This is the starting point for a reader to get familiar with the project. This
project is being developed
using [Unified process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_process) (UP),
[Domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) (DDD)
and [Systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering)
([MIT](https://learn-xpro.mit.edu/systems-engineering)). From the systems
engineering domain, also
the [Object Process Methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Process_Methodology)
is used.

For a quick introduction to the motivation for and the goals that are tried to
be achieved with this project, the UP artifact called
the [Vision document](Vision.md) is available.

### Software Design

For the software design, several methodologies are used:

* [Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_process) (UP)
* [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
  (DDD)
* [Systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering)
  MIT [style](https://learn-xpro.mit.edu/systems-engineering) using
  [Object Process Methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Process_Methodology)


    Agile Scrum is not a software development methodology in itself,
    as it is more of a project management tool instead, in the authors opinion.
    Unfortunately, the experience of the author learns that many people actually
    believe Scrum in itself gets you high quality software. Combine that with
    software programmers posing / presenting themselves as software engineers,
    while knowing nothing about software design, and you end up in the situation
    of poor software maintenance / evolution.
    ( The author considers himself merely a student at this point in his career
    of software engineering )

Following UP, use cases will be described first in the process of creating this
software. In parallel, domain rules will be written down as well as the vision of
this project.
