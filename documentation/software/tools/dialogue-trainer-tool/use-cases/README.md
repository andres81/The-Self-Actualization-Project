# Dialogue Trainer Use Cases

A summation of use cases is given in this document in a terse format: A few
lines of text per use case only. This document should give a brief overview of
the functionality of the Dialogue Trainer Tool (DTT).

## Use Cases

### UC1 - Loading and presenting a dialogue

1. The user loads a dialogue
2. The DTT will process the loaded dialogue and present the dialogue to the user
    * Each dialogue line is clearly distinguishable from other lines
    * Lines from one participant of the dialogue are clearly distinguishable
      from lines of other participants of the dialogue
    * The labels of the participants are clearly visible at each line of the
      dialogue.

### UC2 - Offering translations of the lines of the dialogue and the words in the lines

A dialogue has several lines of text, that can each individually be translated.
Each word in this line can also be translated.
